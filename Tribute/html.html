            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Franz Kafka's legacy is one of profound influence on modern literature, existential philosophy, and psychological thought. His works have shaped the direction of 20th-century literature, particularly through their exploration of themes like alienation, the absurdity of existence, and the complexities of bureaucratic systems. Kafka’s writing resonates deeply with contemporary readers, especially in its portrayal of individuals struggling against forces beyond their control.</p>
            <p>Kafka’s impact extends beyond literature, influencing psychology and existentialist philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. His works are seen as a precursor to the absurdist movement, which explored the meaning (or meaninglessness) of life. Kafka's exploration of human fragility, isolation, and anxiety has found a place in modern culture, inspiring countless adaptations, films, and even music.</p>
            <p>His works continue to be studied and discussed, with modern scholars examining Kafka’s complex relationship with his Jewish heritage, his personal struggles with health and family, and the ways his life experiences are reflected in his writing. Kafka’s influence remains strong, cementing his place as one of the most important figures in modern literature.</p>
